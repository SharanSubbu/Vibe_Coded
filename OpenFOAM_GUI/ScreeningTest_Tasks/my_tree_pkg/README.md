# TreePkg(Binary Tree & YAML Integration)A lightweight Python package for managing Binary Trees with automated YAML serialization.## InstallationOpen the command prompt in 'my_tree_pkg' directory.Run the following command to install the package in editable mode:pip install -e .### DependenciesThis package requires PyYAML. It is automatically installed when using pip install -e .## Features of the package### 1. Reading a YAML FileConvert a structured YAML file directly into a Node object hierarchy.Python code:from tree_logic.core import load_yamltree = load_yaml("test.yaml")  # Loads the structure from 'test.yaml' into a tree object________________________________________________________________________________________### 2. Writing to a User-Named FileSerialize your current tree structure back into a YAML file of your choice.Python code:from tree_logic.core import save_yamlfilename = "my_custom_tree.yaml"  # Saves the tree object to a custom filenamesave_yaml(tree, filename)________________________________________________________________________________________### 3. Creating and Managing NodesThe Node class and add_node helper allow for direct manipulation of the tree structure.Python code:from tree_logic.core import Node, add_noderoot = Node(10)           # Create a new tree (Root)add_node(root, "L", 5)    # Add nodes by path ('L' for Left, 'R' for Right)add_node(root, "RL", 12)  # Automatically handles intermediate empty nodesroot = None               # Delete / Clear a tree root.val = 20             # Edit / Rewrite a value## Sample Script (main.py)The included main.py serves as a demonstration of the package capabilities. When executed, it performs the following:Constructs a tree in memory using the add_node pathing method.Displays the tree structure in the console for visual verification.Writes the in-memory tree to a file named output.yaml.Reads an existing test.yaml and parses it into a separate tree object.To run the sample python script, open command prompt and run the following command in the 'my_tree_pkg' directory:python main.py## Project Structuretree_logic/core.py: Contains the Node class and recursive logic for YAML and pathing.setup.py: Package configuration for pip.main.py: Test suite and usage examples.
